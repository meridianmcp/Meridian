# CLAUDE.md — Meridian User Template

This file is read by Claude Code at session start. Copy it to your project root and
fill in your `project_id` to get Meridian session coordination automatically.

## Connect to Meridian

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meridian": {
      "command": "pixi",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "meridian", "--mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/Meridian"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the hosted tier (no install):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meridian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://usemeridian.us/mcp"],
      "env": { "BEARER_TOKEN": "sk_meridian_YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Your project ID

```
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
```

Get your project ID from the Meridian dashboard at `http://localhost:7878` after
running `create_project(name="your-project")`.

## Session rules

ALWAYS at session start:
- Call `start_session(project_id="PROJECT_ID", session_name="describe-what-youre-doing")`
- This returns the goal, recent tasks, pending sprint items, and active sessions in one call.

ALWAYS during work:
- Call `log_task(session_id, project_id, description)` after completing meaningful work.
- Call `pin_decision(project_id, title, body, category)` for any architectural choice.
- Call `request_hitl(project_id, question)` when you need a human decision before continuing.

ALWAYS before ending:
- Call `checkpoint(session_id, project_id)` — snapshots progress, generates delta handoff, returns next `/goal` string.

## The 5 tools you use 90% of the time

| Tool | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `start_session` | First thing, every session | `start_session(project_id="abc", session_name="auth-refactor")` |
| `log_task` | After finishing anything meaningful | `log_task(session_id, project_id, "Fixed OAuth redirect bug")` |
| `checkpoint` | Before context fills, before ending | `checkpoint(session_id, project_id)` |
| `pin_decision` | Architectural choices | `pin_decision(project_id, "Use psycopg3", "asyncpg has DLL issues on Windows", "TECHNICAL")` |
| `request_hitl` | Blocking questions for a human | `request_hitl(project_id, "Should we rate-limit per IP or per token?")` |

## Auto-checkpoint with hooks

Wire Claude Code to checkpoint automatically on every session end:

```bash
# Mac/Linux
curl -fsSL https://usemeridian.us/hooks.sh | bash

# Windows
irm https://usemeridian.us/hooks.ps1 | iex
```

Prompts for your Meridian URL and project ID, then writes `SessionStart` and `Stop`
hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`. From that point on, every session auto-injects
your project context on start and snapshots progress on end.

## Executor rules (Meridian project only)

- **Secrets hygiene**: Never put credentials, connection strings, API keys, or secrets in chat or task descriptions. Mention env var names only.
- **Before every push**: Run `pixi run test` locally first. CI is a safety net — not the first check. Never push broken code.
- **End every session**: If tests pass, merge `dev → main` and push `main` to trigger deploy. Do not end the session with work stranded only on `dev`.
- **Set sprint name**: Use `PATCH /projects/{id}/goal` with body `{"sprint": "name"}` directly (or the `set_sprint` MCP tool). Do NOT use `set_goal` for sprint-only updates.
- **Handoff**: Use `get_context_block(project_id)` for the handoff context block. Do NOT read from `data/meridian-build_handoff.md` — that file is local-only and not reliable across sessions.
- **Project discovery**: Use `list_projects()` when the project ID is unknown. Never create a project just to get a working ID.
- **Staging pipeline**: `dev push → test → deploy preview → smoke test → merge main → prod`. Rollback fires automatically if prod /health returns non-200 after deploy.
- **Demo write protection**: Adding a new write endpoint requires NO demo exception — the middleware in `server.py` handles it globally. When adding a new write UI element, add it to the `hideDemoAdminControls()` selector list in `dashboard.js`.
