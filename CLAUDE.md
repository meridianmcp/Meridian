# CLAUDE.md — Meridian User Template

This file is read by Claude Code at session start. Copy it to your project root and
fill in your `project_id` to get Meridian session coordination automatically.

## Connect to Meridian

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meridian": {
      "command": "pixi",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "meridian", "--mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/Meridian"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the hosted tier (no install):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meridian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://usemeridian.us/mcp"],
      "env": { "BEARER_TOKEN": "sk_meridian_YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Your project ID

```
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
```

Get your project ID from the Meridian dashboard at `http://localhost:7878` after
running `create_project(name="your-project")`.

## Python one-liners

For stdlib-only scripts (secret generation, JSON parsing, base64, file ops):
- **Windows:** `py -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
- **Linux/Mac:** `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`

Use `pixi run python` only when Meridian deps are needed (psycopg3, cryptography, etc).
Never use PowerShell for logic that Python handles cleanly.

## The 5 tools you use 90% of the time

| Tool | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `start_session` | First thing, every session | `start_session(project_id="abc", session_name="auth-refactor")` |
| `log_task` | After finishing anything meaningful | `log_task(session_id, project_id, "Fixed OAuth redirect bug")` |
| `checkpoint` | Before context fills, before ending | `checkpoint(session_id, project_id)` |
| `pin_decision` | Architectural choices | `pin_decision(project_id, "Use psycopg3", "asyncpg has DLL issues on Windows", "TECHNICAL")` |
| `request_hitl` | Blocking questions for a human | `request_hitl(project_id, "Should we rate-limit per IP or per token?")` |

## Auto-checkpoint with hooks

Wire Claude Code to checkpoint automatically on every session end:

```bash
# Mac/Linux
curl -fsSL https://usemeridian.us/hooks.sh | bash

# Windows
irm https://usemeridian.us/hooks.ps1 | iex
```

Prompts for your Meridian URL and project ID, then writes `SessionStart` and `Stop`
hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`. From that point on, every session auto-injects
your project context on start and snapshots progress on end.

## Executor rules

Executor rules (the behavioral guidelines injected into every `start_session` response)
are managed in the **Meridian dashboard → Settings → Executor Rules**.

You can view, edit, or reset them to the Meridian defaults there.
New projects get the Meridian defaults automatically — no file configuration required.
